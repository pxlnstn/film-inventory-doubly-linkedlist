# Film Inventory Management System 🎬

A console-based Java application that manages a film inventory using a doubly linked list. The program allows adding, deleting, searching, and displaying films sorted by year and title. Data is read from and saved to a .txt file. Efficient.

## 📌 Features

- Stores film details: year, title, genre, director, and a list of actors
- Each actor includes name, gender, and nationality
- Films are inserted into the list sorted by:
  - Primary: release year
  - Secondary: title (alphabetically)
- Supports:
  - Inserting new films
  - Searching and deleting by title
  - Printing all films (head-to-tail or tail-to-head)
  - Printing only films made before 2000
  - Writing final list back to the file on exit

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (OOP)
- Doubly Linked List
- File I/O (`bilgiler.txt`)
- Console-based input/output

## 👤 Contribution

This was a group project.  
I implemented most of the code, including:
- Custom doubly linked list structure
